            What Makes LATAM Art Unique?
          </h2>

          <ul>
            <li>
              A variety of eye-catching colors that grab attention immediately.
            </li>
            <li>
              Strong indigenous influences that define our roots and symbolism.
            </li>
            <li>
              Transformation of European art, we do it our way, with a unique
              twist!
            </li>
            <li>
              Details that blend elements from all over the world, always
              reinterpreted in our style.
            </li>
            <li>
              Natural and tropical designs that connect us with the warmth of
              our land.
            </li>
            <li>
              A fantasy, symbolic, surrealist style fused with nature.
            </li>
            <li>
              A strong symbolic load that represents our identity as
              Latin-Americans.
            </li>
            <li>
              A profound religious component that permeates our traditions and
              daily life.
            </li>
            <li>
              We are united, friendly, talkative, and always support each other
              like one big family.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The essence of Latin America is not only reflected in our works of
            art but also in the way we live and connect with others. Its time
            to capture that energy in your designs and create something that
            transcends, that captures the vibrant essence of LATAM!

            How Do We Apply It Correctly to Our Designs?
          </h2>

          <p>
            Like any other style you want to add to your design, it’s important
            to have the right information to accurately represent the LATAM
            style. As an artist, I always base my designs on three key aspects,
            and I believe these are essential:
          </p>

          <ul className="m-5">
            <li className="flex">
              <span className="text-colorBase text-xl p-2 border-colorBase border-2 rounded-full h-10 w-10 mr-2">
                1.
              </span>

                Functionality
              </span>
            </li>
            <li className="flex mt-5">
              <span className="text-colorBase text-xl p-2 border-colorBase border-2 rounded-full h-10 w-10 mr-2">
                2.
              </span>
              <span className="transition-all duration-500 ease-out bg-orange-400 w-1/4 flex justify-center items-center hover:translate-x-10">
                Composition
              </span>
            </li>
            <li className="flex mt-5">
              <span className="text-colorBase text-xl p-2 border-colorBase border-2 rounded-full h-10 w-10 mr-2">
                3.
              </span>
              <span className="transition-all duration-500 ease-out bg-orange-400 w-1/4 flex justify-center items-center hover:translate-x-10">
                History
              </span>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            These principles will make our design more dynamic, engaging, and
            enjoyable. LATAM places are surreal, full of energy, and magical. For
            a dull and grey world, a magical environment could be a great option
            to convey emotions, powerful vibes, and history through every detail.
          </p>

          <p>
            Not everything has to be pretty and good; LATAM art has its dark side
            with a strong aesthetic because we are direct. We don’t hold back
            when expressing the bad, and that can also be reflected. LATAM art is
            an emotional amplifier, we have no shame, we express ourselves
            naturally, we are sociable, talkative, and loud, we love to party.
          </p>

          <p>
            There are different types of complexity in designing a place, but I
            will explain the basic principles you can implement to capture the
            minimum essence of Latin culture. The extent of “Latino” you want to
            add is up to you.
          </p>

          <p>
            There are also different types of emotions to convey. Personally, I
            will teach you my artistic approach: the realistic, the neutral, where
            few are happy and are blinded by the distortion of social patterns.
            Life is not always as beautiful as it seems.

        BASE OF A LATIN AMERICAN ENVIRONMENT:
      </h2>

      

      <article>

  <h2>South Barranquilla: A Town Disguised as a City</h2>
  
  <div>
    <h3 className="text-orange-400 text-2xl">Cultural Division Based on Economy</h3>
    <p>
      In the south of Barranquilla, humble people are common and vibrant. Their light clothing and customs reflect a lifestyle adapted to the hot climate. The lack of advanced technology and houses rebuilt with basic materials, like red bricks and metal windows, are indicators of advanced poverty.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong className="underline">KEY POINT:</strong> Houses made of basic materials, red bricks, and bars are representative. The bars are a key symbol, as if they were canaries trapped inside.
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h3 className="text-orange-400 text-2xl">Atmosphere and Environment</h3>
    <p>
      The constant noise, music on every corner, and groups watching football are essential parts of the south. The streets are always bustling, with stores on every corner. The warm colors, heat, and strong breezes give the sensation of being at a beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong className="underline">KEY POINT:</strong> The atmosphere is like a beach without water. Mango trees are a must—they must be present.
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h3 className="text-orange-400 text-2xl">Lifestyle</h3>
    <p>
      People are vibrant, party-loving, social, and humble. They often work in factories and lead lives of sacrifice. The houses are crowded, and the streets are dirty, but theres natural art everywhere. Children grow up quickly, and youth is lived to the fullest with few resources, much alcohol, and sometimes crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong className="underline">KEY POINT:</strong> Alleys with two-story houses, bars, and red checkered tiles are fundamental.
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h3 className="text-orange-400 text-2xl">Social Relationships</h3>
    <p>
      Social patterns group people into islands of common interests. Theres loyalty to the groups, and a strong social division. Social problems are faced communally; criminal acts like theft are risky due to the violent response.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong className="underline">KEY POINT:</strong> The caletas, paisa stores with 4x4 trucks, and the communal essence are unique characteristics.
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h3 className="text-orange-400 text-2xl">Style and Architecture</h3>
    <p>
      The houses have homemade fixes, are old, and built by local bricklayers. The furniture is suited for hot climates, and the bars are a constant. The alleys are iconic, representing the essence of towns within the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong className="underline">KEY POINT:</strong> Mango trees, bars, clay tiles, houses connected, and the beach-like atmosphere are essential elements.
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h3 className="text-orange-400 text-2xl">Additional Details</h3>
    <p>
      The people are interesting and vibrant, although there is a lack of discipline in education and business. Juvenile delinquency, caletas, and paisa shopkeepers are part of the social and cultural landscape of the south. Women have a unique beauty adapted to the hot environment, with remarkable genetics.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong className="underline">KEY POINT:</strong> The combination of social, cultural, and economic characteristics makes the south of Barranquilla a vibrant and unique place.
